          <strong> Shukraraj Shastri</strong> (1917-1941)
          <p>
            Shukraraj Shastri, a prominent figure in the 1950 revolution against
            the Rana regime, displayed unwavering courage in the face of
            oppression. As a scholar and patriot, he faced a firing squad in
            Sundhara, Kathmandu, marking a crucial turning point in Nepal's
            quest for democracy.
          </p>

        <li>
          <strong>Dharma Bhakta Mathema</strong> (1894-1941)
          <p>
            Dharma Bhakta Mathema dedicated his life to advocating educational
            reforms and social justice. Leading the 1951 education reform
            movement, his commitment to quality education for all left an
            indelible impact. His execution during the revolution emphasized his
            resolute dedication to the values he championed.

          <strong>Dashrath Chand</strong> (1912-1941)
          <p>
            Dashrath Chand, an instrumental figure in the fight against the
            autocratic Rana rule, contributed significantly to the 1950
            revolution. His commitment to democratic ideals and sacrifices made
            during the revolutionary period exemplify his pivotal role in
            shaping Nepal's political landscape.

        <li>
          <strong>Gangalal Shrestha</strong> (1913-1941)
          <p>
            Ganga Lal Shrestha, a key leader in the Nepali Congress movement,
            played a crucial role in challenging the Rana regime. His leadership
            during the 1950 revolution was instrumental in establishing
            democracy in Nepal. Facing the gallows, Shrestha's sacrifice
            symbolizes resilience and determination for a free and democratic
            Nepal.
