# CODSOFT 

LEVEL-1
Projects I'll be doing as a task to complete my internship at CODSOFT.


TASK-1: Landing Page
 --This task was done using only HTML, CSS and JS.

Check out a special webpage I made for a web development internship task. It's on Netlify, and it's about a small tea cafe that I have always dreamt about starting as my own business at some point.
