# CODSOFT
Projects I'll be doing as a task to complete my internship at CODSOFT.


TASK-1:
 --This task was done using only HTML and CSS.
 Check out a special webpage I made for a web development internship task. It's on Netlify, and it's all about remembering some important people from Nepal who did brave things     for their country. The page is easy to use and tells their stories in a cool way. Take a look and learn about the heroes who made a big impact!
